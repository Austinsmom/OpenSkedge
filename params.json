It's for assigning positions to people at certain times during certain time periods that they have marked themselves available. It won't schedule your meetings (at least, not yet).\r\n\r\n### Who is behind OpenSkedge?\r\n[Max Fierke](http://www.maxfierke.com), an open-source developer and student at the University of Minnesota. He does [a lot of other stuff](https://github.com/maxfierke/) too. He created OpenSkedge during his winter break. He also has [a site you can go to](http://www.maxfierke.com).\r\n\r\n# License and Copyright\r\n### License\r\nOpenSkedge, technically a derivative work of Employee Scheduler, is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.\r\nSee src/OpenSkedge/AppBundle/Resources/meta/LICENSE for more details.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Copyright 2012-2013 Max Fierke (@maxfierke)\r\n* Copyright 2012-2013 University of Minnesota - Carlson School of Manangement\r\n* Copyright 2003 Brigham Young University (For the bits of Employee Scheduler present)\r\n\r\n### Projects that OpenSkedge uses\r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) by @twitter\r\n* [TODC Bootstrap](https://github.com/todc/todc-bootstrap) by @todc\r\n* [TODC Datepicker](https://github.com/todc/todc-datepicker) by @todc\r\n* [Colorpicker for Bootstrap](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-colorpicker/) by Stefan Petre\r\n* [TableSorter](http://tablesorter.com/) by [@lovepeacenukes](https://twitter.com/lovepeacenukes)\r\n* [Symfony 2.3 LTS](http://symfony.com/), [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and dependencies specified in composer.json\r\n\r\n### Thanks to the following Employee Scheduler developers\r\n* John Finlay (Developer of Employee Scheduler)\r\n* Carl Allen (Developed time clock functionality for the UofMN with Joe Krall)\r\n* Joe Krall (Developed time clock functionality for the UofMN with Carl Allen)\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n**Max Fierke**  \r\nHomepage: [www.maxfierke.com](http://www.maxfierke.com)  \r\nTwitter: [@m4xm4n](http://twitter.com/m4xm4n)  \r\nGithub: [@maxfierke](https://github.com/maxfierke)  ","google":"UA-37627208-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
